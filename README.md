This was a bot I created to auotmate tedious manual tasks for a group I was in, it was during the beginning of my programming adventure, hence the poor quality code. I wrote this in 2020.

It used the roblox api, discord, trello & other apis to gather all the information, analyze it and then send out an embed containing all the relevant information.

This was for a community on roblox called the "Canadian Roleplay Community" in which I am currently a developer.
